# *Space Burger Joint* study project

[Link](https://rmxr.github.io/react-burger/) to the project deployed at GitHub-Pages.

This is class project I did when studying React, Redux, React DND, routing, authorization, and testing.
I built it while studying at Yandex.Practicum in several stages, learning one technology at a time and gradually
increasing the project's complexity.
The project is a generic one, however, I've written all the code here myself.

The site offers you the functionality of a fictional Space Burger Joint. On the main screen you may build your own
burger by dragging various ingredients into the field on the right. You may rearrange the order of components in the
constructor by dragging and dropping them. To place an order you have to be signed in. Feel
free to sign up with whatever e-mail and password, the info is not used anywhere else, but it emulates how a real site
would handle authorization.

The Feed section allows you to see orders placed by other users today, while the Profile section allows you to edit your
username and see the list of the orders placed by you.
